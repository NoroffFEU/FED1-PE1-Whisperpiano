    <h3 class="interview-question">Can you tell us about your journey in music production and how you got started in the hip-hop scene?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">It was quite natural. I lived in a town (Elda, Alicante) with a rich urban history, a lot of movement, and hip-hop culture. From a young age, we grew up on the streets, skating, watching older kids break dance, freestyle rap, and seeing graffiti all around.</p>
    <p>As the years passed, around 2005, I met a good friend who had just moved from Barcelona, one of the most influential cities in the national hip-hop scene. With him, the seed was planted, and we started creating songs and rapping over internet instrumentals (which was quite a challenge to find back then).</p>
    <p>Hip-hop became deeply ingrained in my life, to the point where I set up a small recording studio. Shaping the lyrics I wrote became a passion, and hearing them through speakers was the ultimate satisfaction.</p>
    <p>It evolved gradually, and by the end of 2009, we released our first self-edited demo with a group called NSK, a group that to this day remains some of my best friends and colleagues. From then on, I started producing my own beats, all digital sound, to self-sustain. It was an endless flow of ideas and songs that I filled on any blank piece of paper I found. The recording and production studio improved, new colleagues and influences with more experience led to three solo works (2009 - "Las dos caras", 2010 - "Un día más", and 2012 - "El hombre islamista"), with my own productions and collaborations that I couldn't have imagined in 2005. Two more works in 2014 and 2015 with Lume. During that time, I contributed my bit to anyone starting out in rap, helping them with beats, providing the studio, and supporting the projects they had in mind, making them a reality.</p>
    <h3 class="interview-question">What was it like running a studio and collaborating with other rappers? Any memorable moments or stories you can share?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">Incredible. Working to shape thoughts from a crumpled piece of paper into a sound track is magical. The recording process, being entirely self-taught, was slow until we achieved a professional sound. Working with so many different artists gave me many different perspectives on the culture and on each of their inspirations.</p>
    <p>One of the moments I remember most fondly was when I invited all the artists from the area to participate in an album to celebrate that the studio had completed a year in 2010. The hours of recording, the attention to detail, and the enthusiasm that everyone put into each track. It was hours and hours of cleaning tracks, equalizing voices, and mastering everything, but I think it's one of the works that I still listen to and it brings a smile to my face.</p>
    <h3 class="interview-question">How do you approach the production process for hip-hop music? Do you have any characteristic technique or sound that defines your style?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">I've always used music as a tool for liberation, more for myself than for the listener. Let's say the process has always been from the inside out, pure introspection, more of a necessity than a hobby.</p>
    <p>We could say that the most characteristic thing is that both the beats and the songs tell a story, and that story lives within me. Each song is a chapter I've chosen to share with the listener, as if it were a book, recounting events you can relate to and empathize with, drawing a small reflection from each of them.</p>
    <h3 class="interview-question">In your opinion, what are the essential elements of a successful hip-hop song, both from a production standpoint and in terms of lyrical content?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">I suppose this will depend a lot on the audience you're addressing. For me, a good hip-hop song has to have a transcendent message, an idea that makes you think and reflect, that lets you draw your own conclusions and leads you to see life through the artist's eyes. Personally, if you accompany that with a good beat, with a strong and raw bass, you already have a song I'll put on repeat day and night. Sometimes the simple, musically speaking, has more hook than something complicated with a lot of ornamentation; it's a style of music that doesn't reward a beat being complicated in terms of production.</p>
    <p>But well, it's the opinion of someone whose Spotify has more songs from the 2003-2010 era than from today's music scene. So don't take my word for it too seriously, hahaha.</p>
    <h3 class="interview-question">Do you have any advice for aspiring music producers looking to establish themselves in the hip-hop industry?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">Enjoy it, I think that's what it's all about. If you spend enough time doing something for pleasure, in the end, you'll become good at it. Enjoy the journey without obsessing over the destination; the beauty is in the journey. The more hours you dedicate to this, the easier it will be. Work on something you like, and you'll never have to work again; that's kind of the advice. If you like it, go ahead, it won't be a bed of roses, but then again, what path is? Don't give up, because there will always be an opportunity around the corner, you just have to try, once, twice, and a thousand times if necessary. Fall, get up, and repeat.</p>
    <h3 class="interview-question">Do you have any projects or collaborations you're particularly proud of?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">I think that every collaboration and every project I've embarked on has taken a piece of me. But I would say that the person I've enjoyed collaborating with the most and shared a lot of time in the studio with is Lone. When I started going to concerts in small venues, he sang with a group, and I thought his style was incredible. We met through mutual acquaintances years later and collaborated several times, being a support for me both in hip-hop and in my daily life.</p>
    <h3 class="interview-question">How do you think the hip-hop landscape has evolved since your active period?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">I would say its evolution has been similar to that of other musical styles. Many variants have emerged, all related to hip-hop and its musical format, but standing out in sounds, speeds, themes, etc. Like everything else, as hip-hop music consumption grows, it brings more variety.</p>
    <p>Perhaps when we started out, everything was more taboo, marginal music made by and for a segment of society less privileged. But like in the United States or France (to give examples), it has lost that marginal touch of protest and revolution music, evolving into a more commercial music style, with more artists, more producers, and more support from record labels and distributors, making hip-hop something normalized and with more audience than ever.</p>
    <h3 class="interview-question">Finally, do you have any musical projects in mind currently, or do you plan to become active in the hip-hop scene again in the near future?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">It's something that's always on my mind. I love creating music and enjoy it in all its processes. As for whether I have a musical project in mind today, no. But I have no doubt that I will return to the music scene with more hunger than ever, with a thousand and one stories to tell, eager to inspire a new generation.</p>
