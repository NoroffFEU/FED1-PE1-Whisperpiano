          <h3 class="interview-question">What inspired you to become a music producer? Was there a specific moment or experience that led you down this path?</h3>
          <p class="interview-answer">From a very young age, I grew up listening to the dance music that my parents played at home, that Italo Disco from the '70s, '80s, and '90s. Or how they would play Chimo Bayo, and I, still in diapers, would already be dancing to it. I must have been about 8 or 9 years old when I was given a PlayStation 1, and among the platform games, I had one, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBzFeOn0PEs" target="_blank">Music 2000</a>, which allowed me to make music. That was when I started creating my first "songs." I remember having to save the created song on the console's MemoryCard if you wanted to store it to listen to it again, and since I didn't have it yet, I would plug in the VHS and record the song on a video tape. Maybe that was the starting point.</p>

          <h3 class="interview-question">What is your creative process when producing music? Do you have any rituals or particular methods you follow?</h3>
          <p class="interview-answer">I always start with an idea, or a melody that comes to me while walking down the street, or an old vocal that I like and think could fit in a current remix. I always start with a concept. Sometimes, I can simply be playing around with different sounds or synthesizers to see if something comes out that I can develop, but that's not the usual.</p>

          <h3 class="interview-question">What aspects of music production do you find most challenging and which are the most rewarding?</h3>
          <p class="interview-answer">The most challenging for me is achieving a very clean and perfect sound while also creating catchy melodies and harmonies that stick in your head. The most rewarding is, first, achieving these two tasks, which sometimes isn't entirely easy, and second, when you see people enjoying your music and letting you know through their comments or messages.</p>

          <h3 class="interview-question">How would you describe your music production style? Do you have any signature or distinctive elements that reflect in your work?</h3>
          <p class="interview-answer">So far, my style has been the electronic music that was heard on the Mediterranean coast of Spain (the well-known bakalao route), but adapting the sounds to the present day. It's a style within electronic music, with quite aggressive sounds and fast rhythms, around 140bpm and beyond. As a distinctive element, I always try not to overload my productions excessively; I like to keep it minimalistic, so each sound has its space and can be appreciated.</p>

          <h3 class="interview-question">Do you have any memorable stories behind the creation of a particular song or album? What makes it special to you?</h3>
          <p class="interview-answer">Well, maybe it's the first single that I managed to get released on the market in vinyl format. After several attempts with different record labels, I got one of them to accept the track and release it in physical format. It was a very special moment for me because I had always dreamed of having my music on vinyl.</p>

          <h3 class="interview-question">What advice would you give to someone just starting in the world of music production?</h3>
          <p class="interview-answer">I would tell them not to give up, to keep going, that music is a very beautiful world, and if they really like it, they won't mind the effort they have to make to achieve their goals. Try to finish each song, even if you don't like it, experiment with different genres, or collaborate with other producers; it can be very enriching.</p>

          <h3 class="interview-question">What exciting projects do you have in mind for the near future?</h3>
          <p class="interview-answer">I am going to collaborate soon with a very good childhood friend of mine, who is a professional in the music world, and he has proposed we make a track together. I am very excited about it because it's a project we've been talking about for a long time, and we are finally going to be able to carry it out</p>
