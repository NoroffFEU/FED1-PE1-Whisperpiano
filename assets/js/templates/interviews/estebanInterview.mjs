    <h3 class="interview-question">Congratulations on the premiere of your first symphony at the Teatro Romea in Murcia. How did you feel seeing your work performed on such an important stage, and what was the audience's reaction?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">First of all, thank you very much. Well, the truth is that one feels a mix of many sensations at the moment of a premiere because it involves showing the work of many months in a specific moment. I felt mostly grateful that it could take place and supported by a good reception from the audience towards the work.</p>
    <h3 class="interview-question">What was the composition process for that particular piece like, and what inspired its creation?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">The composition process was lengthy, as it is a large-scale work. I believe that the concept of inspiration in art has always been surrounded by a halo of mysticism that may be justified. It is undeniable that there is always a human component beyond the technique used to achieve it. However, I like to talk about different types of inspiration (if possible) depending on the type of repertoire being composed.</p>
    <p>In the case of programmatic music, that is, music that describes situations, this inspiration is usually directly taken from a source external to the music itself. In the case of pure music (which does not follow a program or does not pretend to have descriptive or evocative characteristics), this inspiration arises from the musical materials themselves in their primary form, which are tried to be exploited to the fullest extent according to their development over time.</p>
    <p>For me, since the conception of this symphony is a pure musical work, it is more related to this second case.</p>
    <h3 class="interview-question">What musical and stylistic influences do you find most prominent in your work as a composer?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">Above all, I consider that my influences focus on any musical practice that does not lose sight of communication (which is so denigrated today). Within this maxim, many types of music are encompassed: From classical tradition to film music composers passing through the great masters of the 20th century such as R. Strauss, B. Britten, or Rachmaninov.</p>
    <h3 class="interview-question">Is there any classical or contemporary composer whom you especially admire or who has significantly influenced your style?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">I greatly admire classical composers like Beethoven, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, etc. I also know and admire the work of contemporary composers like John Williams, Alma Deutscher, or Howard Shore (in the international sphere); and Juan Durán, Fernando Alonso, or Arturo Díez Boscovich (in the national sphere).</p>
    <h3 class="interview-question">What is your opinion on the role of classical music in today's society, and what do you believe is its relevance in the modern world?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">I believe that, unfortunately, it is not valued enough, not because people don't like it, but due to a profound ignorance. It is something that we must reflect on as a society... Gradually, artistic quality has been lost as a result of the division that has occurred between "cultivated" and "popular" music. I think that if people had access to a minimum level of education in the musical field (minimums that are not provided with the current state of music in our compulsory education system), they would truly learn to value and enjoy this wonderful art.</p>
    <h3 class="interview-question">Do you have any new musical projects in mind after the premiere of your symphony, or are you working on any other project currently?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">Currently, I am immersed in delivering final projects in the conservatory field. For now, I don't have any closed composition projects, but I hope to set some new goals for the coming academic year.</p>
    <h3 class="interview-question">Finally, is there any message or advice you would like to share with other emerging composers who are starting their careers in classical music?</h3>
    <p class="interview-answer">Of course. I would like to express an opinion that I believe is quite unpopular within this circle, but that I feel as a truth that I cannot ignore. And it is that for approximately 100 years, the "avant-gardes" have burst into art and have established themselves (some with more acceptance and others with less) as the status quo within the academic world.</p>
    <p>Far from intending to change the thoughts of the artists who may read me in these lines, and even further from judging their work, I would like to make a plea and (above all) an invitation in favor of critical thinking.</p>
    <p>How pretentious it is to see professionals (from all disciplines) buy into the avant-garde discourse of "new creation," and pretend to make and unmake the rules of understanding and communication at will behind a curtain of technical and mathematical complexity.</p>
    <p>My way of thinking about this is clear: We are not Gods. We do not create or destroy in terms of sensory perception. We simply order a discourse, not invent languages that no one is capable of understanding. In this way, I believe that creation would be approached with more respect and with truly artistic results: always seeking a maximum degree of technical cleanliness but never despising its more human side.</p>
