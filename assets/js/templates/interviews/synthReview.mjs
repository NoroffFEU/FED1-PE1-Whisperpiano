            <h3 class="interview-question">From Physics to Sound: The Early Steps</h3>
            <p class="interview-answer">The earliest synthesizers were complex and expensive instruments, based on physical principles like additive synthesis and subtractive synthesis. These methods involved generating or manipulating sound waves through vacuum tubes, electronic circuits, or even mechanical components.</p>
            <p>One of the first synthesizers was the Telharmonium, created in 1897 by Thaddeus Cahill. This instrument utilized tone wheels to generate complex sounds, but its size and complexity limited it to research and demonstration applications.</p>
            <p>The most famous early synthesizer was the Theremin, invented by Lev Termen in 1919. This contactless instrument is controlled by moving one's hands near its antennas, creating an ethereal and otherworldly sound that made it a popular element in science fiction and suspense music.</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">The Electronic Era: Synthesizers for the Masses</h3>
            <p class="interview-answer">The 1960s saw the rise of electronic synthesizers, with models like the Moog Modular System and the ARP 2600 becoming essential tools for experimental musicians and composers. These instruments offered greater flexibility and control over sound generation, enabling the creation of a wide range of timbres and effects.</p>
            <p>The Moog synthesizer, developed by Robert Moog in 1964, became an icon of electronic music, used by artists like Wendy Carlos, Keith Emerson, and Tangerine Dream to explore new sonic territories. Its voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) allowed for creating complex and dynamic sounds, while its filter and envelope shaped the texture and evolution of the notes.</p>
            
            <h3 class="interview-question">The Digital Revolution: Synthesizers for Everyone</h3>
            <p class="interview-answer">The advent of the digital age in the 1980s marked a turning point in the evolution of synthesizers. Digital synthesizers, like the Yamaha DX7 and the Roland D-50, offered greater precision, control, and a vast array of presets, making them more accessible to musicians of all levels.</p>
            <p>The Yamaha DX7, released in 1983, was a resounding success, popularizing FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis and becoming one of the best-selling synthesizers in history. Its ability to create bright and metallic sounds made it a staple in genres like pop, rock, and new wave.</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">The Modern Era: Hybrid and Software Synthesizers</h3>
            <p class="interview-answer">Today, modern synthesizers combine analog and digital technologies, offering an unimaginable range of sonic possibilities. Hybrid synthesizers, like the Moog Sub Phatty and the Novation Ultranova, blend the warmth and expressiveness of analog synthesizers with the precision and versatility of digital ones.</p>
            <p>Software synthesizers have also gained immense popularity, allowing musicians to create complex and professional sounds from their computers. Programs like Native Instruments Massive and Xfer Serum offer an intuitive interface and a wide range of tools for synthesis and sound design.</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">Impact on Music: A Universe of Sounds</h3>
            <p class="interview-answer">Synthesizers have had a profound impact on popular music, from the progressive rock and synth-pop of the 1970s and 1980s to the hip-hop, electronic dance music, and pop of today. Their ability to create new timbres and textures has fueled musical experimentation and opened up a universe of unprecedented sonic possibilities.</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">Conclusion: An Ongoing Journey</h3>
            <p class="interview-answer">The evolution of synthesizers continues at an accelerated pace, with new models and technologies emerging constantly. From complex modular synthesizers to intuitive mobile apps, the quest for new sounds and forms of musical expression remains the driving force behind innovation in the world of synthesizers.</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">Fun Facts About Synthesizers:</h3>
            <ul>
