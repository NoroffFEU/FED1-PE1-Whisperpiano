            <h3 class="interview-question">How did you first become interested in playing the guitar, and what inspired you to start sharing your solos on Youtube?</h3>

            <p class="interview-answer">I first became interested because there was a guitar in the house and I asked my father to teach me. He taught me some chords and I started practicing from there. Eventually the bands I listened to got me more excited to keep playing and then I was obsessed. Sharing videos online started many years ago, where I made some original songs that I wanted to share. Then I got an assignment in music school to transcribe and learn a solo, and I thought I might as well film it and post it since I have already spent the time learning it. I really ended up liking this process so I decided to stick with it and now it has become one of my main projects to build my YouTube channel.

            <h3 class="interview-question">Can you walk us through your practice routine? How do you maintain such a high level of technical skill?</h3>

            <p class="interview-answer">These days my practice routine mostly revolves around projects I’m working on. Usually that’s a solo I’m either learning or an original one I’m making. Sometimes it’s a concert I have to practice for. So the main focus is on the projects, but then I usually have some sessions for general practice as well, where I work on things like technique, improvisation, ear training, rhythm etc. without a specific goal other than improvement. I also try to get in some practicing at my job whenever there is free time. But I do not have a set schedule for how long or which topics. It’s more just doing what I can every day. The technical stuff is probably maintained through using it on a daily basis, although I still feel like I have a lot of refining to do in that area.</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">As someone who also works at a cultural school, how do you balance teaching and creating content for your YouTube channel?</h3>

            <p class="interview-answer">It can be hard. I try to practice a little bit before work + at work when I can + after work. It might just be short sessions, but at least I get something done before and after most of the time. I have also set up my schedule so that I work only monday, tuesday and wednesday, so that I can feel more free to practice how I want the rest of the week. Content creation does take some time too. Often I try to multitask so that when I’m listening to my recorded videos, I’m usually also eating, and when editing videos I am often combining it with working out or something. But it does take up some extra time for sure.</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">What role does improvisation play in your soloing process? Do you have any tips for aspiring guitarists looking to improve their improvisational skills?</h3>

            <p class="interview-answer">Improvisation is a huge topic that challenges many aspects of your playing. Instrument knowledge, rhythm, time, technique, ear training, theory, musical taste and the list goes on. And in some genres and styles the approach can be slightly different. It’s hard to give a general answer for everyone, but there are some elements that will probably be important for everyone:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Knowing chord tones (arpeggios) on your instrument well</li>
                <li>Learning the vocabulary of the type of improv you want to do</li>
                <li>Knowing scales on your instrument (at the very least the major scale and the pentatonic scale)</li>
                <li>Being aware of phrasing and HOW you play, and not just what you play. This also includes leaving space and motivic development.</li>
                <li>Developing technique</li>
                <li>Training your ears</li>
                <li>Being able to play with rhythmic variety and good time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="interview-answer">This topic could go on for hours, but those are some good basics that should be helpful to almost anyone. Improvisation’s role can be different. Sometimes I improvise 100%, sometimes I know how I want to start a solo, but improvise the rest, and sometimes I compose the whole thing. In most live settings I usually just improvise, but for videos I tend to end up with a mix since I can be a bit of a perfectionist and it takes time before I am happy enough to upload something.</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">Many guitarists struggle with stage fright or performance anxiety. Do you have any advice for overcoming nerves and delivering confident performances, both live and in recordings?</h3>

            <p class="interview-answer">The biggest one is to just keep doing it until it gets less scary. Everyone kind of knows this already, but it’s not always easy for everyone to find a place to do it often enough. I was lucky enough to play at a weekly jam session almost every weekend for 3 years in my hometown where I just played with everyone even if I didn’t know the songs. So I got used to that, but I still got nervous sometimes if it was an important concert, or there were really good musicians in the audience or something like that. It has gotten better now for that as well, but I still don’t think I am immune to it, but it’s very rare now. In recordings I am by myself and I don’t get nervous or anything, but I can be distracted by the “red light syndrome” where I get more self conscious about my playing when I hit record. So I start making more mistakes and get distracted by being on camera. That has gotten better too, but it’s still there a little bit.</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">What are some common mistakes or misconceptions you see among aspiring guitarists, and how can they be overcome?</h3>

            <p class="interview-answer">It depends on the level of the guitarist I think. Beginners often don’t understand that they should be trying to play things with an even tempo. It’s better to play slow and even, than fast, but having to stop and start all the time. For intermediate guitarists it might be that they don’t want to spend time on learning the “boring” stuff like technique, theory, ear training etc. Many students really like learning songs, but their technique and knowledge of the instrument can hold them back from improving faster. For advanced people it might be important to not lose sight of phrasing, vibrato, melody and musical tastefulness when implementing more advanced concepts to your playing.</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">Looking ahead, what are your goals and aspirations as a guitarist and content creator on YouTube?</h3>

            <p class="interview-answer">As a guitarist (and musician) I have many things I am working on. I have a new exercise I’m working on for my timing that I am applying to as many instrument techniques as possible for example. I also want to have more fluency in my improvising and be more consistent in the quality of my improvisation. I also have some things about my ear training that I feel I should work more on. I am also re-building my right hand picking technique to be more efficient. I also have a new song I’m writing that I want to release.
            </p>
            <p>As a content creator I have some goals that are short term and some that are long term. A shorter term goal is to reach 3000 watch hours on Youtube within a 1 year period. I also have 2000 subscribers set out as a milestone. I also want to branch into different styles of videos like discussions, interviews, lessons etc. Right now my channel is mostly just me playing and some guitar demos, but I want to have a bit more variety.</p>
            <p>For the long term I want to be able to make more videos and make some money off it, or make money off things related to my online stuff.I have some ideas for tuition material I want to sell, for example. And I want to do online lessons with people and have more freedom over my work time. It would be cool if I could live anywhere and still be able to work by doing it all online</p>
