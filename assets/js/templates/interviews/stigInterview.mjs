            <h3 class="interview-question">As a sound engineer and music producer, could you share a bit about your personal journey in these fields and how you discovered your passion for sound and music production?</h3>

            <p class="interview-answer">I became interested in music at an early age. I started playing organ and piano in the cultural school when I was in fourth grade. I learned notes and enjoyed it. I also played in a band for a few years. But my interest in music really started to grow when I was around 11 or 12 years old. Some friends and I got the opportunity to borrow instruments and play in a band. We played in many different bands in the years to come, and with this, the interest in sound engineering emerged. I found it very exciting and taught myself to use technical equipment when we were practicing and performing concerts. When I was 17, I got to be an apprentice in a recording studio, and then I quickly decided that this was exactly what I wanted to do! After high school, I applied to Oslo and the school that was then called NISS - Nordic Institute for Stage and Studio. Here, I pursued a degree in Program Engineer in Sound Engineering. It was three very enriching years. After this, I started working with sound engineering at concerts. Later, my uncle told me that he let me borrow headphones when I was 3 years old, and I listened to music and thought it was very fun - maybe it started there?</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">How do you approach music production? Do you have a favorite genre or style you specialize in?</h3>

            <p class="interview-answer">I listen to a lot of music and enjoy many different genres. I can listen to folk music, jazz, country, pop, as well as hard rock and electronic music. Nowadays, I'm into modern R&B and hip-hop. I've always believed that good music isn't dependent on genre - there are completely different criteria at play. I like a lot of different music.</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">What challenges do you face working in such varied roles, and how do you overcome them?</h3>

            <p class="interview-answer">Many in our industry work as freelancers - it can certainly be challenging. The workload can vary greatly from week to week, and it can be demanding to manage time in relation to this. The job also entails a wide variety of tasks - it can be challenging at times, but most of all, it's very rewarding.</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">Do you have any recent musical projects or collaborations you're particularly proud of?</h3>

            <p class="interview-answer">I recently worked on sound for the theater production "MARS," written and performed by Odin Staveland at Haugesund Teater. It was a very creative and innovative piece. The sound engineering was quite demanding, with both recorded electronic music, live bands, and actors. I enjoy challenges in my work.</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">What advice would you give to someone interested in pursuing a similar career in sound engineering and music production?</h3>

            <p class="interview-answer">If you're interested, feel free to contact someone you know who works in sound engineering. Ask if you can learn a bit. Experience is the most important thing in this industry. I would definitely recommend going to school in this field if you have the opportunity. Otherwise, I would recommend not being afraid of challenges. Difficult tasks teach you a lot!</p>

            <h3 class="interview-question">Finally, what are your future ambitions in these areas, and what exciting projects do you have in mind?</h3>
            
            <p class="interview-answer">I hope to be able to work in this field for many years to come. It's incredibly exciting, and you never stop learning in this field. You can learn something all the time. I want to improve in the field and keep up with technological developments.</p>
